  // FAQ
  "FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "IS A HAIR TRANSPLANT A LASTING SOLUTION, AND WHY MIGHT MULTIPLE SESSIONS BE NEEDED?": "Is a hair transplant a lasting solution, and why might multiple sessions be needed?",
  "HAIR TRANSPLANTS ARE PERMANENT, USING FOLLICLES FROM THE 'SAFE DONOR AREA' AT THE BACK OF THE HEAD, RESISTANT TO BALDING. THIS PERMANENCE IS BASED ON DR. NORMAN ORENTRIECH'S 'DONOR DOMINANCE' THEORY, ENSURING TRANSPLANTED HAIR RETAINS ITS BALD-RESISTANT TRAITS. HOWEVER, TRANSPLANTS DON'T PREVENT FUTURE HAIR THINNING OR LOSS IN UNTREATED AREAS. ADDITIONAL SESSIONS MAY BE REQUIRED FOR LARGE BALDING AREAS, TO ENHANCE DENSITY, REFINE THE HAIRLINE, OR ADDRESS NEW HAIR LOSS. PARTICULARLY IN YOUNGER PATIENTS, ONGOING PATTERN BALDNESS MAY NECESSITATE FURTHER HAIR TRANSPLANTS FOR SUSTAINED APPEARANCE.": "Hair transplants are permanent, using follicles from the 'safe donor area' at the back of the head, resistant to balding. This permanence is based on Dr. Norman Orentriech's 'Donor Dominance' theory, ensuring transplanted hair retains its bald-resistant traits. However, transplants don't prevent future hair thinning or loss in untreated areas. Additional sessions may be required for large balding areas, to enhance density, refine the hairline, or address new hair loss. Particularly in younger patients, ongoing pattern baldness may necessitate further hair transplants for sustained appearance.",
  "HOW LONG IS THE RECOVERY PERIOD AFTER A HAIR TRANSPLANT?": "How long is the recovery period after a hair transplant?",
  "RECOVERY TYPICALLY TAKES 7-10 DAYS. MOST PATIENTS CAN RETURN TO WORK WITHIN A WEEK, BUT FULL HEALING AND HAIR GROWTH TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS.": "Recovery typically takes 7-10 days. Most patients can return to work within a week, but full healing and hair growth take several months.",
  "ARE THE RESULTS OF A HAIR TRANSPLANT NATURAL-LOOKING?": "Are the results of a hair transplant natural-looking?",
  "YES, WHEN PERFORMED BY EXPERIENCED SURGEONS, TRANSPLANTED HAIR GROWS NATURALLY AND BLENDS SEAMLESSLY WITH EXISTING HAIR.": "Yes, when performed by experienced surgeons, transplanted hair grows naturally and blends seamlessly with existing hair.",
  "WILL I NEED TO SHAVE MY HEAD FOR A HAIR TRANSPLANT?": "Will I need to shave my head for a hair transplant?",
  "NOT ALWAYS. SOME TECHNIQUES ALLOW FOR MINIMAL SHAVING, ESPECIALLY FOR SMALLER PROCEDURES OR CERTAIN HAIR TYPES.": "Not always. Some techniques allow for minimal shaving, especially for smaller procedures or certain hair types.",
